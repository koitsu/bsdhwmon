BSDHWMON(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            BSDHWMON(8)

NAME
     bsdhwmon - hardware sensor monitoring utility

SYNOPSIS
     bsdhwmon [-Jchlv] [-f device]

DESCRIPTION
     bsdhwmon is a user-land application which communicates via SMBus with
     hardware monitoring ICs on motherboards.  Many different pieces of
     information can be returned, but the most common are fan RPMs, processor
     and system temperatures, and motherboard voltages.  All data is sent to
     standard output.  Usage syntax and all errors are sent to standard error.

     The options are as follows:

     -J      Output data in a JSON-compliant format.

     -c      Output data in a comma-delimited format.  Sensor name, its value,
             and the associated unit (V for volts, C for Celsius, RPM for
             rotations per minute, etc.) are individual parameters.

     -f device
             Specify an alternate SMBus device.  Default is /dev/smb0.

     -l      List motherboards supported by bsdhwmon.

     -h      Help or usage syntax.

     -v      Increase verbosity (includes debugging output).

REQUIREMENTS
     bsdhwmon requires a few hardware and software features to function:

     1.   A hardware monitoring chipset that "ties" into SMBus.  This is
          somewhat common on server-class motherboards, but greatly varies per
          manufacturer.  Presently bsdhwmon supports a multitude of Winbond
          (Nuvoton) hardware monitoring ICs, predominantly on Supermicro
          motherboards.  If you're unsure your motherboard is supported,
          running bsdhwmon with the -l option will display a list of supported
          motherboards.  You may also wish to consult your user manual or
          contact the technical support department for your product.

     2.   A system BIOS that provides a SMBIOS table.  Specifically, the
          existence of the smbios.planar.maker and smbios.planar.product
          kenv(2) kernel environment strings.  You can verify the existence of
          these variables by using kenv(1).  This is needed for bsdhwmon to
          reliably auto-detect your motherboard.

     3.   device smb built into your kernel or loaded using kldload(8),

     4.   device smbus built into your kernel or loaded using kldload(8),

     5.   An appropriate SMBus chipset driver, such as amdsmb(4), ichsmb(4),
          or nfsmb(4), built into your kernel or loaded via kldload(8).

     Failure to meet all of the above requirements will result in bsdhwmon not
     functioning.

OUTPUT
     If bsdhwmon emits a message indicating your motherboard is unsupported,
     please follow the on-screen instructions.

     bsdhwmon attempts to mimic output formatting and sensor strings to that
     of the BIOS's Hardware Monitoring menu option (if available).  However,
     due to limited hardware availability and user beta testing, some strings
     may not match the BIOS exactly (such as "PECI Agent" being replaced with
     "CPU Core").  For example, a Supermicro PDSMi+ motherboard would output
     something resembling this:

           CPU Temperature            34 C
           System Temperature         36 C
           FAN1                        0 RPM
           FAN2                        0 RPM
           FAN3                        0 RPM
           FAN4                     2000 RPM
           FAN5                     1527 RPM
           FAN6                     1785 RPM
           Vcore                   1.198 V
           +1.5V                   1.540 V
           -12V                  -12.288 V
           Vdimm                   1.824 V
           +3.3V                   3.344 V
           +12V                   12.000 V
           5Vsb                    5.046 V
           5VDD                    4.974 V
           P_VTT                   1.206 V
           Vbat                    3.184 V

     While an older Supermicro P8SC8 might output this:

           CPU Temperature            33 C
           System Temperature         37 C
           FAN1                     4963 RPM
           FAN2                        0 RPM
           FAN3                        0 RPM
           FAN4                        0 RPM
           FAN5                        0 RPM
           Processor Vcore(V)      1.360 V
           3.3V Vcc(V)             3.320 V
           5V Vcc(V)               3.044 V
           -12V Vcc(V)           -12.288 V
           12V Vcc(V)             12.432 V
           5VSB                    4.896 V
           VBAT                    3.104 V

     Slight differentials in sensor values (e.g. a few degrees, voltage
     fluctuations, or RPM variance) are normal.  Operating systems often make
     use of system and processor which may halt processors while idling (e.g.
     x86 "HLT" opcode), or make use of C1 through C4 power-saving states;
     powerd(8) on FreeBSD is known to do this.  System BIOSes are known to
     offer the ability to throttle fan speed based on load.  Please refer to
     your System User Manual for details.

     Large/severe differences between what the system BIOS and bsdhwmon
     reports should be reported as a bug (e.g. -12.107 V shown in the BIOS,
     while bsdhwmon reports +37.000 V).

EXIT STATUS
     The bsdhwmon utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
     Some Supermicro systems using the Winbond W83792D chipset may report
     incorrect +5V voltages; the Supermicro P8SC8 and P8SCT motherboards are
     such examples.  This is caused by a faulty formula used to calculate
     voltages from IC registers.  The formulas used are not officially
     documented, and the actual circuitry (resistors, etc.) tied to the pins
     on the Winbond chip do not match what Winbond used in their
     documentation.  Formula documentation has been requested of Supermicro,
     but no response has been received at this time.

     There has been an isolated report of a Supermicro P8SCi system
     occasionally reporting extremely high RPMs (in the tens of thousands) for
     some fans.  The reason for this is unknown, but the values being returned
     from the Winbond chipset do appear correct.  If you're experiencing this
     bug, please get in contact with the author.  Git commit ad3bbad may have
     rectified this bug.
