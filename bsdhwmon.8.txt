BSDHWMON(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            BSDHWMON(8)

NAME
     bsdhwmon -- hardware sensor monitoring utility

SYNOPSIS
     bsdhwmon [-Jchlv] [-f device]

DESCRIPTION
     bsdhwmon is a user-land application which communicates via SMBus with
     hardware monitoring ICs on motherboards.  Many different pieces of infor-
     mation can be returned, but the most common are fan RPMs, processor and
     system temperatures, and motherboard voltages.  All data is sent to stan-
     dard output.  Usage syntax and all errors are sent to standard error.

     At this time, bsdhwmon supports a multitude of Winbond hardware monitor-
     ing ICs, predominantly on Supermicro motherboards.

     The options are as follows:

     -J      Output data in a JSON-compliant format.

     -c      Output data in a comma-delimited format.  Sensor name, its value,
             and the associated unit (V for volts, C for Celsius, RPM for
             rotations per minute, etc.) are individual parameters.

     -f device
             Specify an alternate SMBus device.  Default is /dev/smb0.

     -l      List motherboards supported by bsdhwmon.

     -h      Help or usage syntax.

     -v      Increase verbosity (includes debugging output).

REQUIREMENTS
     bsdhwmon requires a few hardware and software features to function:

     1.   A system BIOS that provides a SMBIOS table.  Specifically, the exis-
          tence of the smbios.planar.maker and smbios.planar.product kenv(2)
          kernel environment strings.  You can verify the existence of these
          variables by using kenv(1).

     2.   device smb built into your kernel or loaded using kldload(8),

     3.   device smbus built into your kernel or loaded using kldload(8),

     4.   An appropriate SMBus chipset driver, such as amdsmb(4), ichsmb(4),
          or nfsmb(4), built into your kernel or loaded via kldload(8).

     Failure to meet all of the above requirements will result in bsdhwmon not
     functioning.

OUTPUT
     bsdhwmon attempts to mimic output formatting and sensor strings to that
     of the BIOS's Hardware Monitoring menu option (if available).  However,
     due to limited hardware availability and user beta testing, some strings
     may not match the BIOS exactly (such as "PECI Agent" being replaced with
     "CPU Core").

     For example, a Supermicro PDSMi+ motherboard might output something like
     this:

           CPU Temperature            34 C
           System Temperature         36 C
           FAN1                        0 RPM
           FAN2                        0 RPM
           FAN3                        0 RPM
           FAN4                     2000 RPM
           FAN5                     1527 RPM
           FAN6                     1785 RPM
           Vcore                   1.198 V
           +1.5V                   1.540 V
           -12V                  -12.288 V
           Vdimm                   1.824 V
           +3.3V                   3.344 V
           +12V                   12.000 V
           5Vsb                    5.046 V
           5VDD                    4.974 V
           P_VTT                   1.206 V
           Vbat                    3.184 V

     While an older Supermicro P8SC8 might output this:

           CPU Temperature            33 C
           System Temperature         37 C
           FAN1                     4963 RPM
           FAN2                        0 RPM
           FAN3                        0 RPM
           FAN4                        0 RPM
           FAN5                        0 RPM
           Processor Vcore(V)      1.360 V
           3.3V Vcc(V)             3.320 V
           5V Vcc(V)               3.044 V
           -12V Vcc(V)           -12.288 V
           12V Vcc(V)             12.432 V
           5VSB                    4.896 V
           VBAT                    3.104 V

     Slight differentials in sensor values (e.g. a few degrees, voltage fluc-
     tuations, or RPM variance) are normal.  Operating systems often make use
     of system and processor which may halt processors while idling (e.g. x86
     "HLT" opcode), or make use of C1 through C4 power-saving states;
     powerd(8) on FreeBSD is known to do this.  System BIOSes are known to
     offer the ability to throttle fan speed based on load.  Please refer to
     your System User Manual for details.

     Large/severe differences between what the system BIOS and bsdhwmon
     reports should be reported as a bug (e.g. -12.107 V shown in the BIOS,
     while bsdhwmon reports +37.000 V).

EXIT STATUS
     The bsdhwmon utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
     Some Supermicro systems using the Winbond W83792D chipset may report
     incorrect +5V voltages; the Supermicro P8SC8 and P8SCT motherboards are
     such examples.  This is caused by a faulty formula used to calculate
     voltages from IC registers.  The formulas used are not officially docu-
     mented, and the actual circuitry (resistors, etc.) tied to the pins on
     the Winbond chip do not match what Winbond used in their documentation.
     Formula documentation has been requested of Supermicro, but no response
     has been received at this time.

     There has been an isolated report of a Supermicro P8SCi system occasion-
     ally reporting extremely high RPMs (in the tens of thousands) for some
     fans.  The reason for this is unknown, but the values being returned from
     the Winbond chipset do appear correct.  If you're experiencing this bug,
     please get in contact with the author.  Git commit ad3bbad may have rec-
     tified this bug.
